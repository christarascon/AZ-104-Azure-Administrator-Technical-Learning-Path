## 6. Exam Day Tips

### Tips for the AZ-104 Exam Day
1.  **Get a Good Night's Sleep:** Being well-rested is crucial for focus and clear thinking.
2.  **Review Key Concepts, Don't Cram:** Do a light review of your notes or flashcards, but avoid trying to learn new material.
3.  **Arrive Early (Physical Test Center) / Log in Early (Online Proctored):**
    * **Test Center:** Gives you time to relax, complete check-in procedures without rushing.
    * **Online:** Allows time for system checks, workspace scan, and ID verification. Ensure your environment meets all requirements.
4.  **Read Questions Carefully:** Pay close attention to keywords like "NOT," "MOST," "LEAST," "ALWAYS." Misreading a question is a common mistake.
5.  **Manage Your Time:**
    * The exam has a set number of questions and a time limit. Note the total time and number of questions at the beginning.
    * Pace yourself. If you get stuck on a question, mark it for review and move on. You can come back to it later if time permits.
    * Don't spend too much time on any single question, especially if it's worth only one point.
6.  **Answer Every Question:** There is typically no penalty for guessing on Microsoft exams. If you're unsure, make your best educated guess.
7.  **Use the "Mark for Review" Feature:** If you are unsure about an answer, mark the question. After you've gone through all questions, you can revisit the marked ones.
8.  **Process of Elimination:** For multiple-choice questions, try to eliminate obviously incorrect answers first. This increases your chances of selecting the correct one.
9.  **Case Studies / Scenario Questions:** These can be lengthy. Read the scenario thoroughly first to understand the context, then address each question related to it. You might be able to answer some questions without re-reading the entire scenario each time.
10. **Lab Questions (If Present):**
    * The AZ-104 may include hands-on labs where you perform tasks in a live Azure environment.
    * Read the instructions for each task carefully.
    * Ensure you complete all required steps for a task before moving to the next.
    * The lab environment might be slightly different or slower than your own subscription. Be patient.
    * Sometimes, a task depends on a previous one. If you can't complete an earlier task, try to do as much as you can for subsequent ones.
11. **Stay Calm:** If you encounter difficult questions or feel stressed, take a few deep breaths to refocus.
12. **Review Your Answers (If Time Permits):** After answering all questions, use any remaining time to review your answers, especially those you marked.

### Mistakes to Avoid During AZ-104 Exam
1.  **Not Reading the Full Question/Scenario:** Missing a critical detail can lead to the wrong answer.
2.  **Overthinking Simple Questions:** Sometimes the most straightforward answer is the correct one.
3.  **Second-Guessing Yourself Too Much:** While reviewing is good, constantly changing answers without a clear reason can be detrimental.
4.  **Poor Time Management:** Spending too long on difficult questions and not having enough time for easier ones.
5.  **Ignoring Case Study Details:** For case studies, all the information provided is usually relevant to one or more questions.
6.  **Assuming Answers Based on Real-World Experience Only:** The exam tests specific Microsoft best practices or features as defined in the curriculum, which might sometimes differ slightly from what you do in your specific job.
7.  **Panicking if Labs Don't Work Perfectly:** Sometimes there are minor glitches. Try to work around them if possible, or focus on what you *can* accomplish. The scoring often accounts for partial completion.
8.  **Not Using the Provided Resources (like Microsoft Learn during the exam if allowed for certain question types - check exam UI):** Some newer exam formats might allow access to Microsoft Learn for certain questions. If available, use it wisely.
9.  **Failing to Check Prerequisites/Dependencies in Lab Tasks:** Ensure previous steps are correctly done if a task depends on them.
